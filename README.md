# Trump-Twitter-Project
This is an analysis of Donald Trumpâ€™s tweeting habits.

In this project, datetime and matplotlib are being used to plot the number of Donald's tweets versus the a.) date, b.) day of the week and c.) time of the day. Also, his most used words have been analyzed. A Donald Trump chatbot has also been created that uses his previous tweets to create new tweets.

Please go to Trump Twitter Feed.ipynb to view the complete code.
